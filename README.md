## Summary

This Discord bot will be used to track "karma" of users, similar to Reddit. Upvote and downvote reactions will be counted and be able to be queried for.

## How to run

First, install dependencies with Poetry.

`poetry install`

Then, set the `KARMABOT_TOKEN` environment variable. See the [Environment](#environment) section for more info. `.env` should look like this:

```

```

Finally, run the main bot script with Poetry.

`poetry run python src/bot.py`
